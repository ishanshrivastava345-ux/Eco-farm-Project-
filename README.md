🌱 Eco Farm Project – Smart Growth System (Tinkercad Simulation)

This Eco Farm Project demonstrates a smart plant growth system using Arduino simulation on Tinkercad. It monitors environmental parameters and uses technology to enhance plant growth in a virtual eco-farm. The project integrates:

TMP36 temperature sensor

Potentiometer simulating humidity

16x2 LCD display

Sound system / speaker

The system displays real-time temperature and humidity, and the sound system activates when temperature exceeds 30 °C, simulating plant growth enhancement through sound stimulation.

🔧 Features

Real-time temperature monitoring using TMP36 sensor.

Humidity simulation using potentiometer (virtual sensor in Tinkercad).

Displays temperature & humidity on LCD and Serial Monitor.

Sound system triggers when temperature > 30 °C.

Fully demonstrated using Tinkercad circuits, no physical hardware required.

🖥️ Tinkercad Components Used

Arduino Uno

TMP36 Temperature Sensor

Potentiometer (for humidity simulation)

16x2 LCD (Adafruit LiquidCrystal compatible)

Speaker (sound system)

Jumper wires & virtual breadboard

⚙️ How the Simulation Works

Temperature Measurement (TMP36)

Arduino reads TMP36 analog voltage and converts it to °C.

Humidity Simulation (Potentiometer)

Wiper pin of potentiometer on A2 simulates humidity (0–100%).

Display System

LCD shows temperature and humidity in real-time.

Serial Monitor outputs values for verification.

Sound System Control

Activates when temperature > 30 °C, simulating a growth-enhancing environment.
